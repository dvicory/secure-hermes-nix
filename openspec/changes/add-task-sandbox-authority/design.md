## Context

The QA Effect broker currently receives `worklane` on `POST /v1/environments/ensure`, resolves a fixed worklane policy, and constructs Gondolin network hooks when the VM is created. Hermes is a multi-session gateway, so a process-global lane variable cannot represent concurrent task authority. A model-selected lane is also not authorization.

The pinned Hermes source already provides model-inaccessible task environment overrides, plugin tools, `pre_tool_call` approval escalation, the ordinary approval UI, trusted task/session identifiers, and Kanban lifecycle hooks. The broker already owns SQLite lifecycle state and every guest HTTP/DNS enforcement hook. These are the existing integration points; policy behavior must not be copied into Hermes tool handlers.

The immediate concrete capability is dynamic exact HTTP(S) origin access, including explicitly approved private origins. Credential adapters and other capability kinds need the same grant protocol later but are not implemented as no-ops in this change.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Make task/environment authority broker-owned and independent of model-selected executor routing.
- Let an agent learn from a typed denial, batch the missing capabilities, request approval, and retry in the same VM.
- Apply network grants and revocations live through existing Gondolin hooks.
- Support safe defaults and temporary QA grants without a Nix redeploy; retain durable remembered-rule machinery for a future explicit management plane without exposing it through Hermes' generic approval button.
- Bound approval fatigue and render canonical approval facts rather than model-authored security descriptions.
- Keep Hermes changes generic and small.

**Non-Goals:**

- New credentials or credential adapters.
- Arbitrary mounts, QEMU configuration, guest assets, raw protocols, or unmediated networking.
- Making the execution and control sockets separate Unix security principals; the threat model continues to trust the profile gateway process.
- In-place structural VM changes. Asset, mount, workspace authority, backend, and hard-resource changes recreate a generation.
- Partial approval of individual entries inside one batch in the first UI integration; the model may submit a smaller follow-up batch.

## Component Design

```

The execution socket exposes environment, execution, file, process, status, and health operations. The control socket exposes authority binding, capability preview/request/decision, grant listing, and revocation. Both are mode-0600 and absent from the guest. Interface separation prevents normal adapter code from accidentally turning model fields into authority; it does not claim protection from a compromised trusted gateway process.

## Decisions

### 1. Authority class is separate from executor lane

An authority binding contains:

```text
bindingId, environmentKey, profile, executor,
authorityClass, policyDigest, createdAt, updatedAt
```

`profile` and `executor` are trusted control-plane context. The broker computes effective defaults from immutable policy. `ensure` no longer accepts a `worklane`; it requires an existing binding or creates a binding using the broker-configured profile default. A conflicting rebind fails closed.

**Alternative:** continue passing `worklane` through `ensure`. Rejected because a normal execution client can then select its own authority and a global environment variable cannot represent concurrent tasks.

### 2. One generic Hermes task-authority identity hook

Extend Hermes' infrastructure-only task environment override registry with a typed `authority_binding_id`. Its presence makes `environment_key(task_id, session_id)` derive a distinct opaque key from the trusted task/session identity plus binding ID. The plugin registers it before first environment use. If access is requested after an environment exists, the current conversation VM remains at its prior authority while subsequent calls for the authority-bearing task use the distinct environment.

The plugin re-registers a Kanban task binding in the worker process during session start using trusted `HERMES_KANBAN_TASK` context. No worklane parameter is added to terminal, file, patch, search, process, or execute-code handlers.

**Alternative:** add `worklane` to every handler. Rejected as high-maintenance duplicated authorization plumbing.

### 3. Runtime grants are typed data

The first implemented capability is:

```json
{
  "kind": "network-origin",
  "scheme": "https",
  "host": "docs.example.org",
  "ports": [443],
  "addressMode": "public-only"
}
```

Private access uses `addressMode: "pinned-private"`. Capability preparation resolves the private hostname before approval and returns canonical pinned addresses. Activation stores those addresses; synthetic DNS returns only the approved pins. IP literals are normalized directly. Public origins continue to resolve dynamically but every answer and redirect must remain outside blocked internal ranges.

Unknown capability kinds, fields, schemes, invalid ports, wildcard hosts, userinfo, URL paths/queries, and unsupported protocols fail closed. An approved request is not effective unless the broker can decode and enforce it.

**Alternative:** permit arbitrary policy JSON. Rejected because approval would become an embedded policy language and unknown behavior could silently broaden access.

### 4. Four policy layers

```text
hard enforcement boundary
  ∩ immutable Nix defaults and installed mechanisms
  ∩ durable remembered operator rules
  ∩ active environment/task grants
  = effective authority
```

The immutable policy defines default origins, installed capability decoders, hard resource limits, and broker mechanisms. It is not a static hostname maximum. An operator may approve a new exact public or private HTTP(S) origin without rebuilding Nix because the installed `network-origin` mechanism can enforce it.

Unsupported mechanisms remain unavailable even after approval. Examples include raw guest credentials, arbitrary QEMU flags, an unmediated NIC, and an arbitrary host mount supplied only as model text.

### 5. Dynamic network evaluation does not recreate the VM

Gondolin HTTP and DNS hooks receive a broker callback that evaluates the request against an atomic in-memory grant snapshot. Grant transactions persist to SQLite first and then replace the snapshot. Activation, revocation, and expiry become visible to subsequent requests without rebuilding hooks or the VM.

A grant is bound to the full digest of the immutable rendered Nix policy. A digest mismatch makes it inactive. Broker startup reloads non-expired grants, marks grants from other policy digests inactive, and rebuilds the cache before accepting execution requests.

**Alternative:** rebuild the VM for every network grant. Rejected because it destroys useful task state and makes discovery/approval/retry impractical.

### 6. Capability request lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant G as Guest command
  participant B as Broker network hook
  participant A as Agent
  participant P as Hermes plugin
  participant U as User approval

  G->>B: HTTPS docs.vendor.example
  B-->>G: network.capability_inactive + suggestion
  G-->>A: command failed with typed denial
  A->>P: sandbox_request_access(batch, rationale)
  P->>B: prepare canonical request
  B-->>P: request ID + normalized policy diff
  P->>U: existing Hermes approval UI
  U-->>P: approve task scope
  P->>B: decide(request ID, approved, scope)
  B-->>P: active grant IDs
  A->>G: retry command
  G->>B: same HTTPS request
  B-->>G: allowed in same VM
```

Preparation never activates new authority. For an unbound trusted environment key, it first establishes the broker-configured default binding without creating a VM; conflicting concurrent or existing bindings retain the registry's fail-closed behavior. It then validates and canonicalizes capabilities and resolves the bound authority class's immutable Nix network policy. A batch already covered by that baseline returns `active` without an access request, runtime grant, or approval prompt. Otherwise preparation resolves private pins, coalesces duplicate requests, applies remembered rules, and returns a broker-rendered summary. The plugin passes only a new pending request to the existing Hermes approval callback. The decision call references the broker request ID; it does not repeat model data.

### 7. Scopes and durable overlays

The broker protocol supports:

- `once`: one matching top-level mediated request, consumed atomically;
- `task`: until task completion or explicit revocation;
- `conversation`: until session end/reset or explicit revocation;
- `timed`: until a broker-chosen bounded expiry;
- `profile`: durable exact remembered rule for this broker profile;
- `executor`: durable exact remembered rule for a configured executor lane.

Protocol support is not permission. The rendered profile policy is the upper bound accepted by the broker. For `hermes-qa`, Nix renders only `once` and `task`. The Hermes plugin schema accepts only those two requested scopes, passes `allow_permanent = false` to the generic approval API, accepts only `once` and `session` results, and maps `session` to the requested task scope. An unexpected `always` result fails closed. Existing non-sandbox Hermes approval callers retain their default permanent-choice behavior.

Profile and executor remembered rules remain broker machinery for a future explicit management plane. They are not available through the QA Hermes approval UI. A later management plane must make durable creation a separate, deliberate action with list/search, provenance, expiry, revoke/bulk-revoke, audit export, and reconciliation against declarative Nix policy; it must also opt those scopes into the immutable profile maximum.

### 8. Approval-fatigue controls are broker state

The broker owns request fingerprints and budgets so gateway restarts do not reset pressure controls:

- one pending request per environment;
- identical pending requests return the existing request ID;
- batches are canonicalized and deduplicated;
- denied fingerprints enter a configurable cooldown;
- a bounded number of new prompts is permitted per task and rolling interval;
- suppressed requests return `approval.request_suppressed` without invoking UI;
- matching remembered exact rules may auto-activate only when a future immutable profile policy enables durable scopes; QA Hermes cannot create them;
- only an explicit `sandbox_request_access` tool call can prompt; an ordinary network denial never opens UI.

The model supplies rationale for task planning, but the approval's security facts come only from canonical broker fields.

### 9. Execution and control protocols

Systemd supplies named socket-activation descriptors for execution and control listeners. The broker rejects control routes on the execution listener and execution routes on the control listener. Health is available on both for activation checks but does not reveal grant content.

The gateway bind-mounts the broker's dedicated runtime directory, not the two
socket files. A file bind mount pins one Unix-socket inode; if NixOS activation
or an operator restarts the socket units, a running container otherwise keeps
the dead inode and cannot reconnect until its Quadlet is recreated. The
root-owned, mode-0711 runtime directory is stable across socket replacement and
is mounted read-only at `/run/hermes-sandbox`, so path lookup reaches the new
mode-0600 runner-owned sockets without exposing unrelated `/run` state or
granting directory mutation.

Control operations:

```text
POST /v1/control/authority/bind
POST /v1/control/access/prepare
POST /v1/control/access/decide
POST /v1/control/grants/revoke
POST /v1/control/grants/list
```

Execution `ensure` takes only `environmentKey`. Structured network denials use stable reasons and include a bounded `suggestedCapability` only when the capability is requestable.

### 10. Persistence and concurrency

SQLite gains strict `authority_bindings`, `access_requests`, and `runtime_grants` tables. Mutations use `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; once-use consumption and revocation are transactional. Grant IDs and request IDs are random UUIDs. Canonical request fingerprints are SHA-256 hashes of normalized capability arrays and binding identity.

The in-memory snapshot is immutable and replaced only after transaction commit. Concurrent network checks observe either the complete old snapshot or complete new snapshot. They never observe partially activated batches.

### 11. Audit and privacy

Audit records include binding ID, opaque environment key, authority class, capability kind, normalized origin, grant scope, decision, reason, policy digest, and timestamps. They exclude command bodies, response bodies, URL paths/queries, headers, credentials, and model rationale by default.

Private resolved addresses are security facts and may be stored in the broker registry, but normal logs show only the approved hostname and address class unless debug diagnostics are explicitly enabled.

### 12. Brokered file operations remain byte-safe

The ongoing QA repair routes patch pre-read, write, and verification through broker file endpoints rather than shell/PTY `cat` output. This is orthogonal to grants but required before the approval plugin can be tested reliably in the same backend. File policy does not become dynamically grantable in this change.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **The control socket shares the trusted gateway principal.** Interface separation prevents accidental authority plumbing but not malicious code execution in the gateway. Mitigation: the gateway remains trusted by the V3 threat model; neither socket enters the guest.
- **The broker contains dormant remembered-grant machinery outside Nix.** Mitigation: QA's rendered policy admits only `once` and `task`, the Hermes plugin disables permanent approval, and persisted state is bound to the full digest of the immutable rendered Nix policy. Policy changes therefore fence earlier grants without a mutable counter. Future durable-rule enablement requires a separate reviewed management plane with list/revoke/export and reconciliation.
- **Private DNS changes may invalidate pinned addresses.** Mitigation: pins are revalidated for every mediated request and changed resolution is denied rather than silently followed. Availability is preferred over following a rebinding target.
- **Existing Hermes approval choices do not support partial batch selection.** Mitigation: batch approval is all-or-nothing; denial tells the model to request a smaller set.
- **A model can still generate annoying requests.** Mitigation: broker prompt budgets, duplicate coalescing, cooldowns, and no automatic prompt on denial.
- **Per-request grant checks add overhead.** Mitigation: immutable in-memory snapshots and exact-key indexes; SQLite is not queried on each HTTP chunk.
- **Once semantics may be too narrow for package managers.** Mitigation: recommend task origin grants for multi-request workflows and reserve once for exact operation adapters.
- **Dynamic private access increases homelab reachability risk.** Mitigation: exact origin/port, pinned private addresses, redirect re-evaluation, no guest-visible socket, bounded scope, and canonical approval display.

## Migration and Rollback

1. Add registry tables and control protocol while retaining the fixed profile default.
2. Change `ensure` to ignore/remove client worklane selection and bind the configured default.
3. Add live grant evaluation and contract tests with no Hermes integration.
4. Add the generic Hermes authority identity hook and plugin.
5. Enable dynamic grants only for `hermes-qa` on `hvn-hyp1`.
6. Exercise denial, approval, retry, expiry, revocation, restart, and fatigue controls.

For the socket-directory cutover, deploy the matching QA Hermes release first.
The pre-cutover socket units already create `/run/hermes-qa-broker`, so the new
gateway can bind the directory and continue using the old sockets. Deploy the
host NixOS configuration second; replacement socket inodes then remain visible
through that existing directory bind. Verify broker health and one terminal
operation after each activation before running the full acceptance prompt. This
ordering limits disruption to broker reconnection and avoids requiring the host
and Quadlet changes to become active atomically.

Rollback disables the plugin and control socket, revokes/quarantines runtime grants, and leaves the broker on its fixed `project` default. Production remains unchanged; QA may return to the rootless-Podman backend if the broker path is unstable.
