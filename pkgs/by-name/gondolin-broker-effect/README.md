# Gondolin Broker Effect

`gondolin-broker-effect` is the Effect-based HTTP broker selected by the
`secureTerminal.backend = "gondolin"` NixOS path. The QA Hermes profile
currently selects it. The legacy broker remains in-tree and tested as a
measured rollback/comparison implementation; it is not started by that path.

## Current scope

Implemented:

- ordinary HTTP/1.1 over separate mode-`0600` execution and control Unix sockets, including systemd named-FD activation;
- strict request/config decoding and RFC 9457 errors with stable `reason` values;
- shared `@agent-x/policy-kernel` authorization;
- broker-owned profile/executor/authority-class bindings and policy-digest-fenced environment lifecycle;
- durable SQLite environment, access-request, and runtime-grant state;
- credential-free Gondolin/QEMU VM creation with one persistent VFS workspace per environment key;
- finite DNS/HTTP policy, synthetic DNS, resolved-address validation, redirect reauthorization, and public/private range classification;
- closed `network-origin` capability preparation with canonical origins and pinned private-address previews;
- dynamic once/task/conversation/timed/profile/executor grants, expiry, revocation, once-use, policy-digest invalidation, coalescing, cooldown, and prompt budgets;
- immutable in-memory grant snapshots consumed by live Gondolin hooks without recreating a VM;
- foreground NDJSON execution with deadline/output/input/concurrency bounds and hard VM close on incomplete termination;
- mediated, byte-safe stat/list/read/write/mkdir/remove operations;
- a thin Hermes HTTPX-over-UDS environment adapter and a separate Nix-built approval plugin;
- fake-runtime lifecycle, direct authority smoke, real Unix-socket HTTP, inherited-listener, rendered-policy, and patched-Hermes contract checks.

Not implemented:

- TCP listening, TLS, remote authentication, SaaS tenant isolation, or a boundary against compromise of the trusted gateway account;
- credential adapters/substitution, secret redaction verification, durable audit delivery, artifact export, or external-effect publication;
- PTY/background process/notification semantics;
- checkpoint/resume or VM adoption after broker restart;
- per-VM cgroup placement, workspace quotas, complete orphan reconciliation, and measured denial-of-service resistance;
- completed V3 adversarial, real-Linux QA, latency, and Podman-parity gates.

The missing items are not implied by Effect, Gondolin, QEMU, or the approval plugin. Effect structures composition and cleanup; QEMU/KVM, Gondolin mediation, systemd, VFS, policy enforcement, the trusted Hermes plugin boundary, and tests carry distinct security obligations.

## Effect patterns used

These choices are deliberate. Pre-1.0 package versions were not excluded merely because of version numbers; each package was judged by fit and operational cost.

### `Context.Tag` and `Layer`

Services are explicit dependencies:

- `BrokerConfig`
- `PolicyKernel`
- `Authorization`
- `Registry`
- `VmRuntime`
- `Environments`
- `Executor`
- `Files`

Production and tests provide different `VmRuntime` layers. There is no runtime “fake fallback” flag in the executable.

`Layer.provideMerge` builds one visible dependency graph. Policy evaluation cannot accidentally depend on Gondolin, SQL, filesystem, network, or credentials because the standalone package has none of those dependencies.

### `Scope` and `Effect.acquireRelease`

- Registry database handles close with their service scope.
- Live VMs close when the environment service scope closes.
- Environment leases use scoped read locks.
- Command concurrency permits release with the stream scope.
- The external Gondolin `AsyncIterable` output is bridged with `Stream.asyncPush` and `Effect.acquireRelease`.

The `asyncPush` bridge is important. Pulling an arbitrary JavaScript `AsyncIterable` directly can leave Effect waiting on a non-cancellable Promise. The push bridge lets stream interruption unsubscribe immediately; the outer finalizer can then hard-close the VM, which releases the SDK producer.

### `TReentrantLock`

Each live environment has a transactional read/write lock:

- ordinary exec/file operations hold a scoped read lease;
- graceful close takes the write lock and waits for active operations;
- hard termination of a leased, uncooperative command intentionally bypasses the writer wait, marks the environment closing, closes the VM, records failure, and removes it from the live map.

That bypass is explicit because waiting for the command's own read lease would deadlock cancellation.

### `TSemaphore`

- one global mutation permit serializes ensure/close/generation transitions;
- one per-environment semaphore enforces concurrent foreground execution limits.

### `Stream`

Foreground execution produces:

1. `start`;
2. zero or more `output` events;
3. `exit`, or a terminal `error` event at the HTTP encoding boundary.

`Stream.interruptWhen` enforces a total deadline. `Stream.ensuring` hard-terminates any environment whose command did not reach a normal result. Client disconnect interrupts the response stream and follows the same cleanup path.

### `Schema`

Config and every HTTP body use exact schemas with `onExcessProperty: "error"`. Unknown fields do not silently disappear. Identifiers, generations, array bounds, integer limits, and canonical base64 are validated before reaching runtime adapters.

### Why not Effect RPC yet

The first replacement transport is ordinary HTTP semantics over a Unix socket:

- easier inspection with standard HTTP tooling;
- explicit status/content-type/stream behavior;
- no dependency on one RPC package's evolving wire format;
- a direct path to a remote HTTP service later.

This is not permission to expose the current listener over TCP. A SaaS deployment needs TLS, authenticated principals, tenant isolation, quotas, replay/idempotency rules, and a remote capability design first.

### Why SQLite is currently `node:sqlite`

The first registry uses Node's built-in synchronous SQLite API behind an Effect service:

- no additional native module;
- no `better-sqlite3` build/package ownership;
- explicit transactions and schema;
- easy replacement behind `Registry` if product topology changes.

`@effect/sql` was not rejected for being pre-1.0. It is deferred because the current single-table local registry does not yet justify another native driver or SQL abstraction. Reconsider it when Agent X/PostgreSQL repositories, migrations, telemetry, and transactional product state move into the implementation.

## Lifecycle statechart

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> creating: ensure reserves generation
    creating --> active: VM starts and registry commit succeeds
    creating --> failed: workspace/VM/registry failure
    active --> active: compatible ensure reuses generation
    active --> closing: graceful close or hard termination
    closing --> closed: graceful VM close
    closing --> failed: hard cancel / close failure / crash recovery
    closed --> creating: later ensure reserves generation + 1
    failed --> creating: later ensure reserves generation + 1
```

On broker startup, persisted `creating`, `active`, or `closing` rows are changed to `failed`. The current package does not adopt unknown QEMU processes. That is conservative but incomplete: a production systemd unit must also kill or reconcile stale processes before accepting work.

## HTTP API

### Wire protocol and Hermes client

The broker speaks ordinary HTTP/1.1 over two Unix domain stream sockets. The
gateway receives only the execution socket; trusted Hermes control-plane code
receives the authority socket. Socket paths are transport configuration and are
not encoded into proprietary URLs. Clients use origin-form paths and a
conventional authority such as `http://localhost`:

```python
import httpx
import json

transport = httpx.HTTPTransport(uds="/run/hermes-qa-broker/broker.sock")
with httpx.Client(
    transport=transport,
    base_url="http://localhost",
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(30.0, read=None),
) as client:
    ensured = client.post(
        "/v1/environments/ensure",
        json={"environmentKey": "conversation-abc"},
    )
    ensured.raise_for_status()

    with client.stream(
        "POST",
        "/v1/exec",
        json={
            "environmentKey": "conversation-abc",
            "generation": ensured.json()["generation"],
            "argv": ["printf", "hello"],
        },
    ) as response:
        response.raise_for_status()
        for line in response.iter_lines():
            event = json.loads(line)
```

Hermes v2026.7.7.2 already pins `httpx[socks]==0.28.1`, whose
`HTTPTransport` and `AsyncHTTPTransport` both accept `uds=...`. The integration
therefore needs no client dependency and no hand-written socket framing.
Hermes' existing `tools/code_execution_tool.py` UDS transport is a separate,
bespoke RPC protocol and is not reused here.

The conventions are:

- request URLs are `http://localhost/v1/...`; `localhost` is a placeholder
  authority and is never resolved;
- request bodies are UTF-8 `application/json`;
- unary responses are `application/json`;
- execution responses are streaming `application/x-ndjson`, one complete JSON
  event per line;
- pre-stream failures use RFC 9457 Problem Details with
  `application/problem+json`;
- `Cache-Control: no-store` applies to all broker data responses;
- authorization is the mode-`0600` socket boundary plus broker policy, not an
  HTTP bearer credential; authority bind/status routes exist only on the
  separately owned control socket.

There is no IETF URI scheme for “HTTP over UDS.” Passing the socket path
out-of-band while preserving unmodified HTTP/1.1 messages is the established
client/server convention used by HTTPX, curl's `--unix-socket`, Docker, and
similar local APIs. Do not invent a `unix://` application protocol.

Problem responses carry the standard RFC 9457 members plus stable broker
extensions:

```json
{
  "type": "urn:agent-x:gondolin-broker:error:policy.denied",
  "title": "policy.denied",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "policy did not authorize the broker operation",
  "reason": "policy.denied",
  "details": {}
}
```

`reason` is the stable programmatic discriminator. `detail` is explanatory and
must not be matched by clients. Details are suppressed for 5xx responses.
Responses include `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. The local socket is mode
`0600`.

### Health

`GET /v1/health` exists on both sockets and identifies its plane:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "plane": "execution" }
```

### Authority and access control plane

Only the control socket exposes:

- `POST /v1/control/authority/bind`
- `POST /v1/control/authority/status`
- `POST /v1/control/access/prepare`
- `POST /v1/control/access/decide`
- `POST /v1/control/grants/list`
- `POST /v1/control/grants/revoke`
- `POST /v1/control/grants/revoke-environment`

`bind` records `{environmentKey, profile, executor, authorityClass, policyDigest}` and rejects conflicting rebinding. `ensure` uses broker defaults only when no trusted hook has already bound the key; model-facing execution requests cannot select authority.

`prepare` accepts an environment key, a closed capability batch, requested scope, optional bounded duration, and rationale. If the trusted key is not yet bound, preparation conflict-safely installs the broker-configured default authority without creating a VM. It canonicalizes and deduplicates capabilities, resolves the effective immutable Nix network policy, classifies addresses, and enforces the policy ceiling. A batch already covered by the immutable policy returns `active` without an access request, runtime grant, or approval prompt. Otherwise preparation coalesces compatible pending requests and applies denial cooldown and rolling prompt budgets; the response is `pending`, `existing-pending`, `active` through a matching remembered grant, or a stable structured error such as `approval.request_suppressed`.

Here “immutable” means fixed for the active Nix policy digest, not permanent across deployments. A `once` or expiring grant remains consumable or expirable when it supplies authority outside that baseline. A request cannot use a narrower dynamic scope to remove authority that Nix already grants; operators who require temporary-only access must omit that origin from the baseline.

`decide` accepts a pending request ID, `approve` or `deny`, an optional approved scope/duration, and a trusted principal. Approval and all grant mutations commit SQLite state before publishing a new immutable in-memory snapshot. List and revoke operations are principal checked. Task/session lifecycle hooks use `revoke-environment` with explicit scopes.

Supported grant scopes are `once`, `task`, `conversation`, `timed`, `profile`, and `executor`. Profile/executor grants are remembered rules and become active only when authority and requested capability still match the current policy digest. Policy changes revoke incompatible durable grants; expiry and once-use are transactional.

The protocol vocabulary is broader than any one deployment's authority. `grantPolicy.allowedScopes` is the immutable upper bound enforced during preparation and decision. The QA Hermes policy currently admits only `once` and `task`; its plugin cannot create conversation, timed, profile, or executor grants. `policyDigest` is SHA-256 over the complete immutable Nix policy material, so a rendered policy change automatically fences persisted environments, requests, and grants without a counter.

### Ensure an environment

`POST /v1/environments/ensure`

```json
{
  "environmentKey": "conversation-abc"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "environmentKey": "conversation-abc",
  "generation": 1,
  "state": "created",
  "profile": "hermes-qa",
  "executor": "hermes-gateway",
  "authorityClass": "default",
  "policyDigest": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "decisionDigest": "..."
}
```

A compatible live environment returns `state: "reused"`. An authority-class or policy-digest change requires a new environment generation.

### Status

`POST /v1/environments/status`

```json
{ "environmentKey": "conversation-abc" }
```

### Close

`POST /v1/environments/close`

```json
{
  "environmentKey": "conversation-abc",
  "generation": 1
}
```

Every authority-bearing request after ensure carries the broker-issued generation. Stale generations fail.

### Foreground execution

`POST /v1/exec`

```json
{
  "environmentKey": "conversation-abc",
  "generation": 1,
  "argv": ["sh", "-lc", "printf hello"],
  "cwd": "/workspace",
  "env": { "LANG": "C.UTF-8" },
  "stdinBase64": "",
  "timeoutMs": 30000,
  "outputLimitBytes": 1048576
}
```

Content type: `application/x-ndjson`.

```jsonl
{"type":"start","environmentKey":"conversation-abc","generation":1,"decisionDigest":"...","timeoutMs":30000,"outputLimitBytes":1048576}
{"type":"output","sequence":0,"stream":"stdout","dataBase64":"aGVsbG8="}
{"type":"exit","exitCode":0,"signal":null}
```

After headers are sent, failures are encoded as a terminal NDJSON event because HTTP status can no longer change:

```jsonl
{"type":"error","reason":"exec.timeout","message":"command exceeded its deadline","details":{"timeoutMs":30000}}
```

### Files

All file routes are `POST`:

- `/v1/files/stat`
- `/v1/files/list`
- `/v1/files/read`
- `/v1/files/write`
- `/v1/files/mkdir`
- `/v1/files/remove`

Common fields:

```json
{
  "environmentKey": "conversation-abc",
  "generation": 1,
  "path": "/workspace/file.txt"
}
```

Relative paths resolve under the configured guest workspace root. Absolute paths must already be inside that root. NUL bytes and lexical escapes are rejected.

`read` returns canonical base64. `write` accepts canonical base64 and optional `create`/`truncate`. File size and directory entry ceilings are enforced both before and, for reads, after the underlying operation to catch growth races.

Gondolin's pinned `RealFSProvider` performs lexical and realpath containment against its host root. Broker path checks do not replace that provider boundary.

## Configuration

Environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `GONDOLIN_EFFECT_POLICY` | yes | Absolute or working-directory-relative JSON policy/config file |
| `GONDOLIN_EFFECT_STATE_DIR` | yes | Registry and workspace state root |
| `GONDOLIN_EFFECT_SOCKET` | no | Unix socket path; defaults under state dir |
| `GONDOLIN_EFFECT_CONTROL_SOCKET` | no | Privileged authority-control Unix socket path; defaults under state dir |
| `GONDOLIN_EFFECT_PROFILE` | no | Profile label used in VM session labels |

Example file:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "policyDigest": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
  "policy": {
    "version": 1,
    "statements": [
      {
        "effect": "allow",
        "actions": [
          "environment.ensure",
          "environment.status",
          "environment.close",
          "exec.foreground",
          "fs.stat",
          "fs.list",
          "fs.read",
          "fs.write",
          "fs.mkdir",
          "fs.remove"
        ],
        "resources": ["environment:conversation-*"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "defaultExecutor": "hermes-gateway",
  "defaultAuthorityClass": "default",
  "maxEnvironments": 4,
  "assets": {
    "default": {
      "path": "/nix/store/...-gondolin-root.qcow2",
      "buildId": "rootfs-build-1"
    }
  },
  "worklanes": {
    "default": {
      "asset": "default",
      "memoryMiB": 1024,
      "cpus": 2,
      "workspaceGuestPath": "/workspace",
      "limits": {
        "maxCommandMs": 30000,
        "maxOutputBytes": 1048576,
        "maxInputBytes": 1048576,
        "maxFileBytes": 8388608,
        "maxListEntries": 1000,
        "maxConcurrentExecs": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`environment.ensure` advertises only the implemented `network` obligation; other actions advertise none. Any policy statement requiring an obligation not explicitly supported by that enforcement point fails closed.

## V3 compatibility matrix

“Compatible” below means behavioral intent, not byte-for-byte transport compatibility.

| V3 behavior/contract | Effect broker status | Compatibility debt / follow-up |
|---|---|---|
| Length-prefixed framed Unix protocol | Replaced by HTTP/JSON and NDJSON over Unix socket; Hermes HTTPX adapter is patched in | Keep the adapter thin; do not add legacy framing to core services |
| Socket-local trust boundary | Preserved by the NixOS mode-`0600`, gateway-owned activation socket | Validate ownership and no TCP listener on the deployed host |
| `ensure` with server generation | Preserved; Hermes sends the canonical conversation-derived environment key | Stop treating conversation strings as the final Agent X product identity model |
| Compatible ensure reuse | Preserved for same worklane and policy digest | V3 also considers asset/template/policy/mount topology; add a complete immutable environment fingerprint |
| Recreate on incompatible state | Partial | Current comparison omits template version, mount topology digest, runtime generation, and adapter generation |
| Durable latest generation/state | Preserved in SQLite | Add migrations, tombstones/retention, crash injection, backup/restore, and multi-process exclusion |
| Restart reconciliation | Conservative rows-to-failed only | Kill/adopt/reconcile actual QEMU processes and stale mounts before listening |
| QEMU/KVM production runtime | Preserved in adapter | NixOS unit must prove `/dev/kvm`, device policy, and hardening compatibility |
| Disposable COW root | Preserved | Validate real guest asset and close/recreate behavior in KVM QA |
| Persistent per-environment workspace | Preserved | Add workspace identity/topology digest, quotas, artifact export, and deletion policy |
| Network mediation bundles | Finite DNS/HTTP policies, public/private classification, synthetic DNS, redirect/rebinding checks, and live runtime grants implemented; WebSocket/raw TCP/SSH remain denied | Run hostile-network and real package/Git workloads on Linux; credentials remain separate |
| Foreground exec events | Preserved semantically; Hermes consumes the NDJSON envelope | Add event cursor/replay rules only if the product contract requires reconnect |
| Background processes / notify-on-complete | Not implemented | Design Agent X task/process ownership instead of copying legacy flags blindly |
| PTY open/input/resize/close | Not implemented | Define typed PTY lifecycle and cancellation before exposing it |
| Input/output/deadline ceilings | Preserved | Add per-action unit-bearing policy types and adversarial tests |
| Hard cancellation via VM close | Preserved and tested with fake runtime, but intentionally coarse | Gondolin 0.12.0 abort only rejects the host session; it does not confirm guest-process termination. Add guest-side signal/kill-and-confirm before preserving a VM after request loss; until then disconnect cancellation sacrifices ephemeral VM state for containment |
| File stat/list/read/write/mkdir/remove | Preserved semantically | Run path/symlink/hardlink/race/atomic-write and guest/direct-VFS concurrency gates |
| Network, VFS, resource admission | Network and VFS enforcement plus static live-VM ceiling implemented; no per-VM cgroups or workspace quotas | Complete V3 resource/adversarial gates |
| Static policy/grants | Shared pure kernel plus transactional runtime grants, immutable snapshots, expiry/revocation/once-use, cooldown, and budgets | Add product-grade audit, migrations, external publication, and credential capabilities |
| Audit records | Not implemented | Decision digest is not an audit log; add durable request/decision/enforcement/result/publication events |
| Legacy broker error reasons | RFC 9457 body with stable reason/status surfaced by the Hermes adapter | Measure legacy reason parity where callers depend on a specific reason |
| systemd activation and hardening | Wired with inherited FD, dedicated UID, KVM condition, and systemd protections | Prove the evaluated unit against real KVM/VFS workloads on Linux |
| Nix package | Built and selected by the QA Gondolin backend path | Keep the legacy package as tested rollback until parity gates pass |

## Agent X boundary and compromises

The broker deliberately keeps these integration boundaries visible:

1. **`environmentKey` remains a flat transport identifier.** Trusted Hermes code derives it from task/session context and binds it to profile/executor authority. A future Agent X product identity can replace the derivation without changing model-facing tool schemas.
2. **Worklanes and ceilings are immutable broker config.** Callers cannot select arbitrary VM resources, asset paths, network rules, or authority through execution requests.
3. **Mutable access is broker-owned local state.** Runtime grants, approval requests, cooldown, and budgets are implemented in SQLite and immutable live snapshots. They are not yet Agent X/PostgreSQL product state and have no durable publication/audit pipeline.
4. **The policy kernel remains pure.** Capability preparation, address resolution/pinning, transactional consumption, and Gondolin hook composition live at enforcement edges rather than inside the pure policy evaluator.
5. **Socket ownership authenticates a profile, not a human or conversation.** Authority binding prevents accidental/model-selected key changes. A compromised gateway account can still call both sockets and act as any environment in that profile.
6. **Hermes owns approval presentation.** The trusted plugin prepares canonical requests before prompting and records the effective generic approval choice. The broker owns policy ceilings and durable grant state; neither layer treats model text as approval.
7. **Only foreground exec and ordinary file operations exist.** PTY/background semantics need explicit Agent X task/process ownership rather than a blind legacy port.
8. **Credentials and external publication are absent.** No raw-secret or generic bearer-token path is implied by runtime network grants.

Follow-up design and acceptance gates are also documented in `policy-kernel/README.md`.

## Security properties and non-properties

### Enforced now

- no guest credentials supplied by the broker;
- production Linux VM requests QEMU/KVM with no silent acceleration fallback;
- disposable COW root and only the configured VFS workspace exposed;
- strict execution/control socket route separation and mode-`0600` local transport;
- exact request schemas, closed capability/action registries, and fail-closed policy;
- broker-owned authority binding and generation fencing;
- default-deny mediated DNS/HTTP with internal-range, redirect, and rebinding checks;
- policy-bounded runtime grants with transactional expiry, revocation, once-use, cooldown, budgets, and immutable live snapshots;
- bounded input/output/time/concurrency/files/listing;
- hard close after incomplete exec;
- database and state paths created with restrictive modes.

### Not proven by this package

- KVM isolation under hostile guest code;
- kernel/QEMU/Gondolin vulnerability resistance;
- VFS correctness under symlink/hardlink/race attacks;
- complete process-tree termination timing;
- cgroup memory/CPU/process containment;
- host systemd hardening compatibility;
- resource fairness or denial-of-service resistance;
- durable audit or external-effect exactly-once behavior;
- tenant isolation or remote service security.

## Testing and acceptance

Local contract suite and focused backend-neutral authority smoke:

```sh
npm test
npm run test:smoke
```

Nix package, rendered-policy startup, and inherited-socket checks:

```sh
nix build \
  .#checks.aarch64-darwin.gondolin-broker-effect \
  .#checks.aarch64-darwin.secure-terminal-effect-policy-http
```

The fake runtime tests prove broker contracts and cleanup logic, not VM containment.
The focused smoke covers structured denial, canonical capability preparation, approval, same-generation retry, live revocation, and environment restart. It is ordinary Node test logic; the Nix package invokes the same test rather than redefining it.
The current QA selection is an explicit integration stage, not a production parity
claim. Before promotion, run the existing V3 acceptance workload against both
brokers and compare:

- every operation/result/error;
- hard cancellation and stale output;
- path and filesystem race cases;
- anonymous package/Git workflows with the reviewed network policy;
- cold latency and resource ceilings;
- restart, orphan, registry, and workspace behavior.

Then record `continue`, `redesign`, or `retain Podman` as required by V3.
